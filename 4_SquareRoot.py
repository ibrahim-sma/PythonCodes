4) Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H] Following are the fixed values of C and H:  C is 50. H is 30.
D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.
Example: Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:
100,150,180. 
The output of the program should be: 18,22,24
